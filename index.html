        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jackson Burgess. I was born and raised in North Vancouver and have lived there all my life. <br>
           I love computers, YouTube, and badminton; I also love to eat all day, every day. The main reason why I <br>
           took CIT is because I want to learn more about programming and to have enough skills in order to enter <br>
           the IT sector someday. Here is a <a href="resume.html" style="color: blue">link</a> to my resume in 
           HTML form. Here is a <a href="Jackson's Resume 1.pdf" style="color:blue">link</a> to my resume in PDF form.

                <p>Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in 
                   writing with their supervisors, colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and 
                   entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly, and effectively. 
                   This course will teach you how to be a professional and efficient communicator at work. 
                   You will write effective business correspondence and instructions and deliver a formal 
                   oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles and basic 
                   patterns on which you will build more advanced applications in the second term.</p>

                <p>This course introduces the fundamental principles and techniques for designing and 
                   developing effective Web sites. Topics include: hand-coding pages with HTML; styling 
                   text and content with CSS; adding dynamic features with client-side scripting 
                   techniques; server-side scripting, and, managing files and Web sites using FTP 
                   software. Students will also be introduced to information architecture and interface 
                   design, XML, as well as advanced mark-up techniques using DHTML. This course is the 
                   foundation for more advanced web courses.</p>

                <p>The course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming for IT professionals,
                   with a focus on scripting languages that are commonly found in the workplace. Projects,
                   assignments, and activities are representative of tasks that IT professionals are likely
                   to encounter in the workplace.Students taking this course will design, implement, test,
                   and debug programs that incorporate: variables, expressions, assignments, I/O, conditional
                   and iterative control constructs, functions, and parameter passing. The course assumes no 
                   previous programming experience.</p>

                   information technology. It is designed to provide a good base for future technical and
                   programming courses. Topics to be covered include select topics from discrete mathematics
                   such as Boolean algebra, numeric systems and data representation, as well as algebraic 
                   fundamentals such as algebraic operations, functions, equations and logarithms, linear

                <p>This course presents the study of factors that either influence or are influenced by 
                   people at work. This course will focus on macro factors such as organizational change; 
                   group factors such as team dynamics, leadership, conflict and power; and micro or individual
                   factors such as personality, attitudes, perception and motivation. An understanding
                   of these topics will enable students to predict, influence and understand how the behaviour
                   of individuals and teams impacts the effective operation of organizations.</p>
